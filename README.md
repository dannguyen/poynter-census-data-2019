## Starters

- Should probably sign up for a Google Account (to use Google Sheets) if you don't have one by now
- Visit [https://censusreporter.org](https://censusreporter.org) and fill out this little anonymous data collection form (to be analyzed as an example in class): 
- [Optional] Sign-up for a free [datawrapper.de account](https://www.datawrapper.de/) to make visualizations


## Exploring CensusReporter 

Open and browse the pages for:

- [The United States](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/01000US-united-states/)
- [Illinois](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/04000US17-illinois/)
- [Chicago](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/16000US1714000-chicago-il/)
- [Census Tract 3201, Cook, IL](https://censusreporter.org/profiles/14000US17031320100-census-tract-3201-cook-il/) which is the tract for the address [205 North Michigan Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60601,](https://censusreporter.org/locate/?lat=41.886024&lng=-87.623542&address=205%20North%20Michigan%20Avenue,%20Chicago,%20Illinois%2060601,%20United%20States)
- Some other town/city not Chicago (e.g. where you lived before moving here, or where you last visited)

Take notice at:

- Look at what data points are emphasized by CensusReporter
- Look at how data changes in quality/interest-level as you move from one geographic category to another
- Compare what the Census data says to what you assume about these places


### Spreadsheet warmup with our collected data

> Note: the best thing you can do to understand data is to get [familiar with spreadsheets](https://multimedia.journalism.berkeley.edu/tutorials/spreadsheets/) and use them as often as possible (more than daily!). That's the most important skill, but we won't have time to get through it in this workshop.

The class data from the Google Form should be copied here:

http://bit.ly/warmzipcode

Do these things:

- Make a copy of the sheet
- Make a column that shows the percentage-point difference between the "White %" values of people's "work area" and their "origin zip code"
- Make a column that shows the ratio of origin-zip-code median household income to work-area-median-household-income
- Try to make a visualization from these derived columns

## Cleaned Census Data warmup

The spreadsheet at https://bit.ly/TKTK contains cleaned up **state-level data** from two sources: 

- Census: median income and poverty level info
- Elections:

Try to make some charts from it using Google Sheets
