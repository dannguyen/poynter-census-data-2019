An assortment of story ideas using Census data, to give you ideas, and also point of references for navigating Census data.




Adults are living with their parents more than ever
===================================================

`Census news story: A Third of Young Adults Live With Their Parents <https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2017/08/young-adults.html>`_

    Check out the linked `Census report here <https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2017/demo/p20-579.html>`_

    I wasn't able to find the Census data for previous years. But here is the adults-living-with-parents in the latest ACS (search in AFF for "household relationship")

    `B09021: LIVING ARRANGEMENTS OF ADULTS 18 YEARS AND OVER BY AGE <https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_17_5YR_B09021&prodType=table>`_




Population loss in Chicago and Cook County
==========================================

Great `visualizations by the Chicago Tribune <https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-met-census-chicago-cook-county-population-decline-20190408-story.html>`_

    Worth noting that population estimates/decline by year (and migration numbers) are only available at metro and state and county levels:

            The data released Thursday includes population numbers by county and by metropolitan region only. State-by-state data came out in December and showed Illinois declining in population for the fifth year in a row, losing roughly 45,000 residents from 2017 to 2018.




Factchecking Mike Huckabee
==========================

    `Huckabee Exaggerates State’s Income Gains <https://www.factcheck.org/2015/05/huckabee-exaggerates-states-income-gains/>`_

    Looking at the Census median household income data, via FactCheck.org:

        The median household income in Arkansas rose 9.3 percent in inflation-adjusted dollars from 1995 to 2006, ranking the state 28th out of 50 states and the District of Columbia during that 11-year period, according to Census Bureau data.

    Also, Politifact:

    `Mike Huckabee says he 'raised average family income by 50 percent' as Arkansas governor <https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/04/mike-huckabee/mike-huckabee-says-he-raised-average-family-income/>`_




Even more localized crime analysis
==================================

`More city neighborhoods see increase in violent crimes, new data analysis shows <https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/public-safety/story/2019-06-05/more-city-neighborhoods-see-increase-in-violent-crimes-new-data-analysis-shows>`_



.. ifnotslides::

    The San Diego Tribune uses Census block groups data to make crime trends much more localized than the usual precinct boundaries. This makes trends/incidents feel more immediate to the reader, though with a possible tradeoff in statistical accuracy.

        Overall, San Diego remains a city with low — but slowly increasing — violent crime. Reported violent crime increased about 3 percent from 2017 to 2018


        ...From just five violent crimes reported in all 2014, the roughly 2,600 residents living in an area bounded by Logan Avenue, Interstate 805 and 43rd Street experienced 22 crimes in 2018.


Private enterprise uses Census data to expand
=============================================

`Why Trader Joe's will never come to your small town <https://www.al.com/business/2015/04/why_trader_joes_will_never_com.html>`_


For instance, take the well-received Trader Joe's, which is opening a store in Birmingham near Mountain Brook.  While its selection criteria is not explicitly public, recent history shows that the grocery chain has strict requirements for household income, education status, and total population.


Analyzing gentrification in nonwhite city centers
=================================================


`The Neighborhood Is Mostly Black. The Home Buyers Are Mostly White. <https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/04/27/upshot/diversity-housing-maps-raleigh-gentrification.html>`_


.. figure:: images/nyt-nonwhite-diversity.png

Showing how the poor and disenfranchised are afflicted
======================================================

`Lead paint poisons poor Chicago kids as city spends millions less on cleanup <https://www.chicagotribune.com/investigations/ct-lead-poisoning-chicago-met-20150501-story.html>`_


.. figure:: images/chitrib-lead-map.png
    :alt: chitrib-lead-map.png


.. ifnotslides::

    They have a nifty interactive to show lead poisoning by neighborhood, but the heart of the story is looking at who suffers most:

    "But children ages 5 and younger continue to be harmed at rates up to six times the city average in corners of predominantly African-American neighborhoods ravaged by extreme poverty, chronic violence and struggling schools, according to a Tribune analysis of city records."



Joining Census demographic data to crime data
=============================================


Great chart via NYT: `In Some Parts of the City, a Common Police Practice <https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/08/16/nyregion/new-york-police-stop-and-frisk-use-of-force-map.html?action=click&contentCollection=N.Y.%2520%252F%2520Region&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=article&region=Marginalia>`_

Stats can be even more compelling in text
-----------------------------------------

`Pockets of City See Higher Use of Force During Police Stops <https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/16/nyregion/in-police-stop-data-pockets-where-force-is-used-more-often.html>`_


- The 46th Precinct has about 128,000 residents and includes the predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods of University Heights, Morris Heights and Fordham. Officers used force in 58 percent of stops last year, the highest rate of any of the city’s 76 precincts

- By contrast, officers in the 111th Precinct in the Bayside neighborhood of Queens, which is 87 percent white and Asian, were the least likely to apply force, using it in 4.7 percent of stops. Yet 40 percent of those stops ended in an arrest.



.. ifnotslides::

    One of my favorite data joins by the NYT, showing how NYPD has higher rates of use-of-force in minority neighborhoods despite lower arrest rates compared to more gentrified neighborhoods.
